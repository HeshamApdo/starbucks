There, he tasted his first sip of Sumatra and was invited into conversation with connoisseurs who took great care in not only finding and roasting the finest quality coffee, but also sharing their passion with others. In 1982, when Starbucks had only four stores, Howard moved to Seattle from his native New York and joined the company as director of operations and marketing.",

He returned in January 2008 as ceo to lead the transformation of the company, bringing the company to sustainable, profitable growth with a renewed focus on Starbucks coffee heritage, innovation and the customer experience. Over the decade, Starbucks grew from 15,000 stores to nearly 30,000, including its groundbreaking Starbucks Reserve® Roastery locations, Community Stores, Military Family stores and a global agronomy center at Hacienda Alsacia. He opened up new educational opportunities through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a first-of-its kind program to give partners a tuition-free college education online and committed to hiring tens of thousands of military veterans and spouses, opportunity youth and refugees.",
                para3: "From the beginning, Howard set out to build a different kind of company –one that delivers business excellence through a culture of compassion. In these early days, Howard created two landmark programs rooted in the fundamental belief that a business can only exceed expectations by sharing success with its people and the communities it serves. First, Starbucks offered comprehensive health coverage for eligible full- and part-time workers, among the first in the retail industry. Second, Starbucks offered partners (employees) equity in the company in the form of stock, called Bean Stock.",
